### What I learned

I learned how to work on big projects ,how to create code which is easy to read and change.Also i learned how to use Json file ,how to update it and etc.


```Javascript
let messageDataIndex = data.comments.find((element) => element.id==clickedButtonParentIndex);
            messageDataIndex.replies.push(newReplyJsonMessage);

```
